                        information. Since technology and privacy laws are always changing, we may occasionally
                        update this policy. If a significant change is made, we will be sure to post a notice in the Enrout
                        application or notify you by email. If you continue to use Enrout after these changes are posted,
                        you agree to the revised policy.
                        This policy is a legally binding agreement between you (referred to in this Privacy Policy as
                        “you” or “your”) and Emenaster Enrout Limited (referred to in this Privacy Policy as “we”,
                        “our”, “us” or “Enrout”). Enrout allows customers like you to pick up, deliver and track, the

                        Privacy Policy and the Enrout Terms of Service. If we add any new features or tools to the
                        Services, they will also be subject to this Privacy Policy.
                        When we use the term “Personal Information” in this policy, it means any information related to
                        an identifiable individual, the name, title, business address, or telephone number of an employee
                        of an organization, credit card and physical location.

                        that you provide to us. If you request access to your Personal Information, we will inform you of
